# Wrangling-OSM-data-for-Madrid
A case study for Udacity's 'Data Science for Business' Nanodegree Program

Please find the report in PDF format in the folder *5 .Report* 

This project was originally done with *SQLite* as database, but afterwards I implemented the same steps with *MongoDB* so I could compare the results.

The differences are in folders 

- 3.Preparing_database
- 4.Database


Every source file relating to the solution using MongoDB has _mongodb trailling the file name.
